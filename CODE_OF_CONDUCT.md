# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The Collective maintains this Q&A portal as an educational resource for investigators, journalists, researchers, and learners. We are committed to providing helpful, ethical, and legally sound guidance.

## Community Standards

### ✅ Do:
- Ask genuine questions about OSINT, AI verification, ethics, or investigative methods
- Provide context through redacted, anonymized examples
- Respect the educational purpose of this portal
- Cite your sources when sharing information
- Engage constructively with answers and follow-up questions

### ❌ Don't:
- Request or share personally identifiable information (PII)
- Ask for assistance with doxxing, harassment, or targeting individuals
- Request intrusion techniques, hacks, or exploits
- Share live investigations that could compromise safety
- Engage in bad faith arguments or trolling
- Violate US or international law

## Safety-First Approach

The Collective operates with clear ethical boundaries:

1. **No Individual Targeting** — We abstract examples and refuse questions that target specific people
2. **Educational Only** — We teach principles and methods, not shortcuts to harm
3. **Legal Compliance** — We will not assist with illegal activities
4. **Live Harm** — Questions involving active danger to individuals will be closed with resources

## Our Response to Violations

Depending on severity, we may:
- Request clarification or redaction
- Refuse to answer with explanation
- Close threads with safer alternatives
- Temporarily or permanently ban repeat violators

## Privacy & Data

- Questions become public once posted
- We may generalize or abstract sensitive details before answering
- We do not collect data beyond what GitHub provides
- Answers are provided as-is for educational purposes

## Questions About This Policy?

Use the **Meta: The Collective** discussion category to ask about our guidelines, suggest improvements, or raise concerns.
